For installing on a jcink site, please see [free codes link]

## Design Elements

This code is fully mobile responsive, designed for screen sizes 320px - 1440px.

- The width of the guidebook on desktop is determined by the full width of the jcink forum's wrapper.
- The height of the guidebook on mobile devices is determined by the amount of content in the tab, but is set to a defined height of 550px on desktop with a scrollbar to view content and can be increased or decreased as desired.
- The menu sidebar is a set 200px on desktop, but this can be increased or decreased as desired. On mobile, the menu is designed to size with the viewport.

A style guide is included on tab 2, and all colors and fonts have been pulled out into CSS variables for quick editing. Any further styling is up to you!
